## Ingredients

### For vinaigrette

 - 2 tablespoons Champagne vinegar
 - 2 tablespoons mild honey
 - 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
 - 1/4 teaspoon salt
 - 1/4 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper
 - 6 tablespoons olive oil

### For salad

 - 4 Oz thinly sliced pancetta (7 to 9 slices)
 - 2 tablespoons olive oil
 - 4 firm-ripe pears
 - 8 cups baby arugula or torn larger arugula (2 1/2 lb)
 - 6 Oz ricotta salata, thinly shaved with a vegetable peeler

## Preparation

### Make vinaigrette:

Whisk together vinegar, honey, lemon juice, salt, and pepper in a salad bowl. Add oil in a slow stream, whisking until combined well.

### Make salad:

Cook pancetta in oil in a 10-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat, turning frequently, until just crisp, about 5 minutes. Transfer to paper towels to drain (pancetta will crisp as it cools). Tear into bite-size pieces.

Halve pears lengthwise, core, and cut lengthwise into 1/4-inch-thick slices.

Add pears to dressing along with arugula, cheese, and pancetta, tossing to coat.
