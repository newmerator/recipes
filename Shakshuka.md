#### Shaksuka Recipe (Israeli comfort food)

[Shakshuka](http://smittenkitchen.com/2010/04/shakshuka/) reminds is incredible. It's the best way to poach eggs that I can think of and it's an easy dish to share.

It will take roughly 45min if you haven't done any of the prep work. I like to substitute cilantro for the parsley, and I add more cumin that it calls for.

Serves 4 to 6

Ingredients:

* 1/4 cup olive oil
* 5 Anaheim chiles or 3 jalape√±os, stemmed, seeded, and finely chopped (I was nervous and only used 2 Anaheims; I would go for 3 or 4 next time for a more moderate but still gentle kick)
* 1 small yellow onion, chopped
* 5 cloves garlic, crushed then sliced
* 1 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1 tablespoon paprika
* 1 28-ounce can whole peeled tomatoes, undrained
* Kosher salt, to taste
* 6 eggs
* 1/2 cup feta cheese, crumbled
* 1 tablespoon chopped flat-leaf parsley
* Warm pitas, for serving
